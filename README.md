# DBTE Text Editor
A text editor that can read and write to any file format!

So this is my programming project for GCSE Computer Science (Coursework module A493). I released the source publicly for the simple reason that I don't mind people seeing it.
I think it's a nice resource for people to potentially learn from.

You can edit this file and release it under your own name etc. Basically just adhere to the Apache V2.0 license :)
