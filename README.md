# DBTE-Text-Editor
A text editor that can read and write to any file format!

So this is my programming project for GCSE Computer Science (Coursework module A493). I released the source publicly for the simple reason that I don't mind people seeing it.
I think it's a nice resource for people to potentially learn from.

You can edit this file and release it under your own name etc. Basically just adhere to the Apache V2.0 license if you don't want to get in trouble :)
